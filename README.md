# Free Technical Documentation Templates:

Welcome!   
These are **free templates** from my full documentation kit â€” designed to help developers, students, and teams write better docs without starting from scratch, and without wasting any braincells.


## What's Included:

1. **Project Overview**  
   A short summary of the project including tech stack, modules, structure, and security notes.

2. **Feature Breakdown**  
   A tabular template to list features by user type, development status, upcoming plans, and wishlist items.

3. **Permission Matrix**  
   A clear table showing user roles, access levels, and how permission logic works in your app.



## Format:

- All files are written in **Markdown (.md)** â€” clean, version-controlled, developer-friendly.
- Designed to be **copied into any project** and used immediately.
- Comes in **bullet & tabular format** â€” no long paragraphs.



## Who Itâ€™s For:

- **Students & junior devs** practicing clean documentation habits  
- **Indie/freelance devs** building projects for hand-off  
- **Anyone** who wants to avoid "blank-page anxiety" when writing docs

"I created these free templates so students, new devs, and indie builders can get used to writing docs early â€” just like we do in real-world teams.

Letâ€™s keep our brainchildren well documented. ðŸ’™"
