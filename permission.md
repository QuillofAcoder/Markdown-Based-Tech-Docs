# Permissions & Access Control (Technical):

This document defines "user roles", what each role can access or perform in the system, and how permissions are handled technically and organizationally.



## User Roles:

| Role Name        | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Guest            | Unauthenticated users (e.g., website visitors)      |
| User             | Registered/logged-in users                          |
| Admin            | Internal team with full control (non-technical ops) |
| Super Admin      | Full access, including technical settings           |
| Support/Staff    | Support team with limited internal access           |



## Access Matrix:

| Feature / Action                 | Guest | User | Admin | Super Admin | Support |
|----------------------------------|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:------------:|:-------:|

## How Permissions Work:

- Role-based access control (RBAC) is used
- Middleware or decorators enforce access at route/controller level
- Example technologies:
  - Python/Django: `@permission_required`, `IsAdminUser`
  - Node.js/Express: role-based middleware
  - Laravel: `Gate`, `Policy`
- Permissions stored in: DB / config / user model
- Access tokens (JWT, session cookies) encode role data
- Frontend hides buttons/sections if user lacks permission (UI-level control)
